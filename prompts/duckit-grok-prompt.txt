Write a detailed plan/spec for a game that uses Phaser Box2D. The game is called DuckIt. It should be a platformer that uses physics to enable a character to jump around and interact with the environment.

There are platforms made up of left, right, and center tiles.

The player is a duck with Idle, dead, fall, jump, and run animations. The player should enter the fall state after the jump animation finishes or the player falls off a platform. The player should enter the run animation when running on a platform or enter an idle state.

There are blocks that the player can push around the screen. The player must move the blocks to access new parts of the level.

There are enemies in the shape of a ball which can move left and right and up and down and will kill the player if it touches them. Enemies cannot move through platforms.

The user should use the keyboard to control the player using the arrow keys, with the up arrow being jump.

Ask me questions to help fill out any missing information in how the game should be made. Do not create the implementation; concentrate on creating the project specification.
