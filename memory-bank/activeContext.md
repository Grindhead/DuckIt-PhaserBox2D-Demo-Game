# Active Context: DuckIt - TypeScript Transition

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is transitioning the existing JavaScript codebase within `vite-template/src` to TypeScript. This involves setting up the TypeScript environment, renaming files, adding types, and ensuring compatibility with Phaser, the custom Box2D integration (`PhaserBox2D.js`), and the provided Box2D type definitions (`types` directory).

## 2. Recent Changes

- Identified that significant progress has been made on the JavaScript implementation in `vite-template/src`, contrary to the initial `progress.md`.
- Installed TypeScript and `@types/node` as development dependencies within `vite-template`.
- Created `vite-template/tsconfig.json` configured to:
  - Use Phaser's built-in types.
  - Recognize the custom Box2D type definitions in the root `types` directory.
  - Allow importing the existing `vite-template/src/PhaserBox2D.js`.
- Updated memory bank files (`progress.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect the current state and the TypeScript transition goal.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Rename `.js` files to `.ts`:** Convert all relevant JavaScript files in `vite-template/src` (and subdirectories like `scenes`, `entities`, `ui`, `lib`) to TypeScript files. Start with `main.js`.
2.  **Add Types:** Incrementally add TypeScript types to the converted files, utilizing Phaser types and the custom Box2D types. Address type errors reported by `tsc`.
3.  **Verify Imports:** Ensure all imports, especially the import of `PhaserBox2D.js`, function correctly in the `.ts` files.
4.  **Update Build Scripts:** Modify `vite-template/package.json` to include a type-checking step in the build process.
5.  **Test:** Thoroughly test the application after conversion to ensure no regressions were introduced.

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations

- **`PhaserBox2D.js` Handling:** Continue using `allowJs: true` in `tsconfig.json` to import the existing JavaScript file. Leverage the provided type definitions in the `types` directory for improved type safety when interacting with Box2D elements, although direct interaction with `PhaserBox2D.js` itself might lack strong typing without a dedicated `.d.ts` for it.
- **Incremental Conversion:** Apply the TypeScript conversion file by file or module by module to manage complexity.
- **Type Strictness:** Maintain `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json` for maximum type safety benefits.

## 5. Important Patterns and Preferences

- Adhere to the patterns established in the existing JavaScript code during the conversion process unless a clear benefit arises from a TypeScript-specific pattern.
- Utilize Phaser 3 and Box2D types effectively.

## 6. Learnings and Project Insights

- The project's actual progress differed from the initial `progress.md`. Regular updates to the memory bank are crucial.
- Phaser 3 bundles its own type definitions, eliminating the need for `@types/phaser`.
- Custom type definitions for the Box2D integration exist and should be leveraged.
