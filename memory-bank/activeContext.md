# Active Context: DuckIt - TypeScript Transition & Entity Implementation

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is continuing to implement core gameplay features from the PRD, specifically:

1. Testing and refining the recently added Crate entity and crate puzzles in level generation
2. Implementing the Enemy entity with proper patrolling behavior and collision handling
3. Implementing the Finish entity with its multiple animation states
4. Ensuring all Box2D collision handling works correctly for player-platform, player-crate, player-coin, player-enemy, and player-finish interactions

## 2. Recent Changes

- Created `Crate.ts` entity with both big and small variants, implementing the 2:1 mass ratio as specified in the PRD.
- Updated `levelGenerator.ts` to place crates on specific platforms to create at least two puzzle scenarios per level.
- Enhanced level generation to create platforms at different heights occasionally to make the level more interesting.
- Updated `GameScene.ts` to handle crate reset when the player dies or the level is restarted.
- Added crate-related constants to `constants.ts` (both physics and asset definitions).
- Added proper TypeScript typing for crates throughout the codebase.
- Updated progress tracking in the memory bank.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Test Current Implementation:** Run the game to verify:
    - Crates can be pushed by the player.
    - Crates have the correct physics properties (big crates heavier than small).
    - Crate puzzles are functional and allow reaching higher platforms.
2.  **Implement Enemy Entity:**
    - Create `Enemy.ts` with patrolling AI (moving at 80% player speed).
    - Add enemy placement to level generation (never on platforms with crates).
    - Implement collision detection to kill the player on contact.
3.  **Implement Finish Entity:**
    - Create `Finish.ts` with the three animation states (Idle, Activated, Active).
    - Place the finish entity at the end of the level.
    - Implement collision handling to trigger state changes and level completion.
4.  **Refine Box2D Collision Handling:**
    - Test and ensure all entity interactions work correctly.
    - Address any issues with physics behavior or collision detection.

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations

- Level generation now creates platforms at different heights to facilitate crate puzzles.
- Crates have been designed to be physics objects that can be pushed but not rotated for better gameplay.
- Need to ensure crates do not fall off their initial platforms as specified in the PRD.
- Need to decide on the best approach for implementing enemy patrolling behavior.

## 5. Important Patterns and Preferences

- Continue using separate entity classes for each game object (Player, Coin, Crate, etc.).
- Maintain consistent approach to physics initialization and collision handling across entities.
- Use Box2D sensors for non-physical collision detection (coins, finish, death sensor).
- Use dynamic Box2D bodies with appropriate physics properties for interactive objects (player, crates).
- Keep entity-specific logic within their respective classes.

## 6. Learnings and Project Insights

- Box2D physics bodies need careful tuning to achieve desired behavior (e.g., crates that can be pushed but don't behave erratically).
- Procedural level generation with physics bodies requires careful consideration of platform placement and object interactions.
- Separating concerns (level generation, entity logic) improves maintainability.
- Using TypeScript with proper types helps catch potential issues early.
