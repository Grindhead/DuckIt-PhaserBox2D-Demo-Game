# Progress: DuckIt

## 1. What Works

- Project definition and requirements are documented in `vite-template/documents/prd.md`.
- Initial memory bank structure and content created.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- The entire game implementation, including:
  - Project setup (Vite, Phaser, Box2D integration).
  - Scene implementation (`Boot`, `Preloader`, `Game`).
  - Asset loading and animation definition.
  - Procedural level generation logic.
  - Player character implementation (movement, physics, states, animations).
  - Platform creation and tiling.
  - Crate implementation (physics, interaction).
  - Enemy implementation (patrolling behavior, physics).
  - Coin implementation (collection, counter).
  - Finish entity implementation (states, interaction).
  - Death conditions (enemy collision, falling off-screen).
  - Input handling (keyboard, mobile controls).
  - UI implementation (coin counter, start/reset overlay).
  - Camera implementation (following player).
  - Responsiveness implementation.

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase:** Project Initialization.
- **Description:** The project is at the very beginning. Requirements are defined, and the initial project structure and setup are the immediate next steps.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- None at this time.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- The project direction is currently solely defined by the initial `prd.md`. No changes or deviations have occurred.

## 6. Comprehensive and Modular To-Do List

1. Project Setup & Environment

   - Initialize Vite project structure and install Phaser.
   - Integrate Box2D via "src/PhaserBox2D.js".
   - Confirm basic file organization (assets, scenes, memory bank).

2. Scenes & Asset Preloading

   - Implement the "Boot" scene for initial configuration (scaling, background).
   - Implement the "Preloader" scene to load the texture atlas and display a loading bar.
   - Prepare animation definitions (duck states, coins, finish entity, etc.) after assets are loaded.

3. Core Physics World

   - Configure Box2D parameters (gravity, debug settings if any).
   - Establish collision rules for platforms, crates, enemies, coins, finish entity, and the "death sensor".

4. Procedural Level Generation

   - Generate tiling platforms (platform-left, platform-middle, platform-right).
   - Introduce crates (respecting 2:1 mass ratio) in puzzle segments where reaching higher platforms is needed.
   - Place enemies (patrolling at 80% player speed) on suitable platforms (no crates).
   - Distribute coins (one per platform tile) at random positions (30px above tile).
   - Place the finish entity on the rightmost side, ensuring the level is completable.

5. Player Character Implementation

   - Create the duck sprite with Box2D physics body.
   - Implement movement logic (run, jump) with state transitions (Idle, Run, Jump, Fall, Dead).
   - Link each state to its respective animation frames at 30fps.

6. Puzzle & Interaction Mechanics

   - Ensure crates are pushable and cannot fall off their platform.
   - Implement coin collection (sensor-based collision).
   - Handle player death from enemies or falling off-screen (sensor 400px below platforms).
   - Activate finish entity on contact (play activation animation, trigger game end).

7. UI & Controls

   - Display coin counter in the top-right corner.
   - Implement "start.png" overlay for death/reset and level completion.
   - Create on-screen direction buttons for mobile; hide them on desktop.

8. Camera & Responsiveness

   - Make the camera follow the player horizontally with subtle easing.
   - Test layout responsiveness on different screen sizes (desktop, mobile).
   - Ensure the game maintains 60fps on various devices and screen resolutions.

9. Testing & Polishing

   - Confirm all animations use `Phaser.Animations.Events` (no `duration` property).
   - Verify puzzle solvability in the generated level (player can reach all important areas).
   - Validate no performance bottlenecks (keep at 60fps).
   - Refine collisions, edge cases (multiple enemies, intense crate usage).

10. Final Integration

- Review PRD requirements to confirm full feature coverage.
- Update the memory bank with any additional findings or patterns discovered.
- Prepare the game for production build via Vite.
