# Progress: DuckIt

## 1. What Works

- Project definition and requirements are documented in `vite-template/documents/prd.md`.
- Initial memory bank structure and content created.
- Significant progress on JavaScript implementation within `vite-template/src`, including scenes, entities, and core logic (exact features implemented need verification).
- TypeScript environment setup (`vite-template/tsconfig.json`, dependencies installed).
- Custom Box2D type definitions available in `types` directory.
- Player entity created (`Player.ts`) with physics body and basic movement/state handling.
- `DeathSensor.ts` entity created.
- Basic UI elements (`CoinCounter`, `GameOverOverlay`, `GameStartScreen`, `MobileControls`) created (JS converted to TS, functionality pending).
- Platform generation logic refactored into `src/lib/levelGenerator.ts`.
- Basic procedural platform generation implemented (multiple platforms with gaps).
- `Coin.ts` entity created with physics sensor body and collection logic.
- `gameState.ts` updated with coin counter.
- Basic level structure (platforms, coins) is generated.
- UI elements are created, but initially rendered under the player.
- UI layering fixed with `setDepth`.
- Level generation logic refactored into separate modules (`platformGenerator.ts`, `coinGenerator.ts`, `gapGenerator.ts`).
- Crate entity (`Crate.ts`) created with Box2D physics, size variations (BIG/SMALL), and logic to prevent falling off platform boundaries.
- `platformGenerator.ts` updated to return platform physics boundaries (`minX`, `maxX`).
- `crateGenerator.ts` module created to handle probabilistic placement of crates on platforms.
- `levelGenerator.ts` updated to orchestrate crate generation using `crateGenerator.ts`, skipping the first platform.
- Player grounding logic (`processContactEvent` in `GameScene.ts`) updated to correctly handle standing on crates (stabilizing impulse made platform-specific, bottom contact inferred if normal is missing but velocity is low).
- Player state logic (`update` in `Player.ts`) handles transitions based on `isGrounded` and velocity, with corrected scaling for velocity threshold checks.
- Adjusted `PHYSICS.PLAYER.JUMP_THRESHOLD` in `constants.ts` in an attempt to improve landing animation transitions.
- Player state logic (`update` in `Player.ts`) refactored to improve Jump -> Fall -> Land (Idle/Run) animation transitions, including simplified airborne logic.
- Player state logic (`Player.ts`) updated to use `ANIMATION_COMPLETE` event on JUMP animation to reliably trigger FALL animation, ensuring correct Jump -> Fall -> Land sequence.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Current Task

- **Current Task:** Test Crate generation and interaction (pushing, boundary constraints, player grounding).
- **Subsequent Tasks:**
  - Verify refactored level generation (platforms, coins, gaps).
  - Implement Box2D collision handling for coin collection.
  - Update Coin Counter UI display.
  - Test crate pushing physics, boundary constraints, and player grounding on crates.
  - Continue TypeScript Transition (convert remaining JS, add types).
  - Implement Enemies (physics, AI, interactions).
  - Implement Finish entity.
  - Refine level generation algorithm (add enemies, ensure solvability, potentially refine crate placement).
  - Implement full Box2D collision handling (player-enemy, player-finish, player-death sensor).
  - Complete UI functionality (start/reset logic).
  - Testing and polishing.

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase:** Implementation & Refactoring (TypeScript Transition, Core Gameplay Features).
- **Description:** The project has a partially implemented codebase, now mostly in TypeScript. Core platforming and coin generation are implemented and level generation logic has been modularized. The next focus is verifying the refactored generation and implementing the core interaction logic (coin collection via Box2D collisions).

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- Player physics only activate after clicking the start screen (expected behavior, but needs testing).
- Coin collection logic relies on Box2D collision handling, which is not yet implemented.
- Coin Counter UI does not yet display the collected coin count.
- Box2D sometimes reports player-crate contacts without a normal vector (`event.normal` is undefined), but grounding logic now handles this by inferring bottom contact based on low velocity.
- Player animation landing transition potentially fixed by event-driven Jump->Fall logic, pending testing.
- Need to verify the exact extent of implemented features in the original JS code (enemies, finish logic might exist partially).
- Potential type errors during the ongoing TypeScript conversion process.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- Decision made to transition the existing JavaScript code to TypeScript before completing all features.
- Utilizing bundled Phaser types and provided custom Box2D types.
- Refactored level generation into a separate module.
- Decided to implement Box2D collision handling using contact listeners.
- Decided to use explicit `setDepth` on UI elements to ensure they render above game objects.
- Further refactored level generation into smaller, specific modules (`platformGenerator.ts`, `coinGenerator.ts`, `gapGenerator.ts`).
