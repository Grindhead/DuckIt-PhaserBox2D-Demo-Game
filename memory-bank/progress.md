# Progress: DuckIt

## 1. What Works

- Project definition and requirements are documented in `vite-template/documents/prd.md`.
- Initial memory bank structure and content created.
- Significant progress on JavaScript implementation within `vite-template/src`, including scenes, entities, and core logic (exact features implemented need verification).
- TypeScript environment setup (`vite-template/tsconfig.json`, dependencies installed).
- Custom Box2D type definitions available in `types` directory.
- Player entity created (`Player.ts`) with physics body and basic movement/state handling.
- `DeathSensor.ts` entity created.
- Basic UI elements (`CoinCounter`, `GameOverOverlay`, `GameStartScreen`, `MobileControls`) created (JS converted to TS, functionality pending).
- Platform generation logic refactored into `src/lib/levelGenerator.ts`.
- Basic procedural platform generation implemented (multiple platforms with gaps).
- `Coin.ts` entity created with physics sensor body and collection logic.
- `gameState.ts` updated with coin counter.
- Basic level structure (platforms, coins) is generated.
- `Crate.ts` entity created with physics body, both big and small variants (2:1 mass ratio as per PRD).
- Level generation updated to include at least two crate puzzles per level.
- GameScene updated to handle crate reset when player dies or level restarts.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Current Task

- **Current Task:** Verify current implementation (physics, platforms, coins, crates) and implement Box2D collision handling for coin collection and crate interactions.
- **Subsequent Tasks:**
  - Implement Enemies (physics, AI, interactions).
  - Implement Finish entity.
  - Refine level generation algorithm (add enemies, ensure solvability).
  - Implement full Box2D collision handling (player-enemy, player-finish, player-death sensor).
  - Complete UI functionality (start/reset logic).
  - Testing and polishing.

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase:** Implementation & Refactoring (TypeScript Transition, Core Gameplay Features).
- **Description:** The project has a mostly implemented codebase in TypeScript. Core platforming, coins, and crates are implemented. The next focus is verifying the current state, implementing enemies, and adding the finish entity.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- Player physics only activate after clicking the start screen (expected behavior, but needs testing).
- Crate physics interactions need testing to ensure they can be pushed by the player as expected.
- Need to verify that crates cannot fall off platforms as per PRD requirements.
- Need to implement and test enemy behavior.
- Need to implement and test finish entity animation and functionality.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- Decision made to transition the existing JavaScript code to TypeScript before completing all features.
- Utilizing bundled Phaser types and provided custom Box2D types.
- Refactored level generation into a separate module, now with support for crate puzzles.
- Decided to implement Box2D collision handling using contact listeners.
- Implemented crates with a 2:1 mass ratio (big:small) as specified in the PRD.

## 6. Comprehensive and Modular To-Do List (Updated Status)

_This list reflects the original plan. Items marked [Partial] or [Done] reflect current progress._

1. Project Setup & Environment

   - [Done] Initialize Vite project structure and install Phaser.
   - [Done] Integrate Box2D via "src/lib/PhaserBox2D.js".
   - [Done] Confirm basic file organization (assets, scenes, memory bank).
   - [Done] Setup TypeScript environment.

2. Scenes & Asset Preloading

   - [Done] Implement the "Boot" scene for initial configuration (scaling, background).
   - [Done] Implement the "Preloader" scene to load the texture atlas and display a loading bar.
   - [Done] Prepare animation definitions (duck states, coins, finish entity, etc.) after assets are loaded.

3. Core Physics World

   - [Done] Configure Box2D parameters (gravity).
   - [Partial] Establish collision rules/contact listener for platforms, crates, enemies, coins, finish entity, and the "death sensor".

4. Procedural Level Generation

   - [Done] Generate tiling platforms (multiple platforms with gaps).
   - [Done] Introduce crates (respecting 2:1 mass ratio) in puzzle segments.
   - [ ] Place enemies (patrolling at 80% player speed) on suitable platforms.
   - [Done] Distribute coins on platforms.
   - [ ] Place the finish entity, ensuring level completability.
   - [Partial] Refine algorithm for solvability and variety.

5. Player Character Implementation

   - [Done] Create the duck sprite with Box2D physics body.
   - [Partial] Implement movement logic (run, jump) with state transitions (Idle, Run, Jump, Fall, Dead) - needs testing/refinement.
   - [Done] Link states to respective animation frames.

6. Puzzle & Interaction Mechanics

   - [Done] Ensure crates are pushable and cannot fall off their platform.
   - [Partial] Implement coin collection (entity logic done, collision pending).
   - [Partial] Handle player death from falling off-screen (sensor exists, collision pending).
   - [ ] Handle player death from enemies (enemy entity/collision pending).
   - [ ] Activate finish entity on contact (entity/collision pending).

7. UI & Controls

   - [Partial] Display coin counter (UI element exists, value update pending).
   - [Partial] Implement "start.png" overlay (element exists, full logic pending).
   - [Partial] Create on-screen direction buttons (element exists, logic needs testing).

8. Camera & Responsiveness

   - [Done] Make the camera follow the player horizontally with subtle easing.
   - [ ] Test layout responsiveness on different screen sizes.
   - [ ] Ensure the game maintains 60fps.

9. Testing & Polishing

   - [ ] Confirm all animations use `Phaser.Animations.Events`.
   - [ ] Verify puzzle solvability in the generated level.
   - [ ] Validate performance.
   - [ ] Refine collisions, edge cases.

10. **TypeScript Transition**

    - [Partial] Rename `.js` in `vite-template/src` to `.ts`.
    - [Partial] Add types incrementally.
    - [Partial] Verify imports (especially `PhaserBox2D.js`).
    - [ ] Update build scripts in `vite-template/package.json`.
    - [ ] Test thoroughly.

11. Final Integration
    - [ ] Review PRD requirements to confirm full feature coverage.
    - [ ] Update the memory bank with final findings.
    - [ ] Prepare the game for production build via Vite.
